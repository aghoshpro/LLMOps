Hello, 

On 22 Jan, 2023 we had a flight from Kolkata (CCU) to Stockholm (ARN) (PNR  JV418P), with connections in Mumbai (BOM) and Istanbul (IST). The flight from Mumbai to Istanbul was delayed 8 hours. It was supposed to leave around 06:55 a.m., however it left at 14:30 on 23 Jan, 2023. This delay cost me numerous damages, including financial, academic, and work-related, which are described below.

1. Missed my flight to Stockholm (ARN) on January 23, 2023 from Istanbul.
2. Also missed my pre-booked train from Stockholm to my home on the same day (cost: 1626 SEK squandered).
3. Would have arrived home at 7:00 a.m. on January 24, 2023 (today), but I arrived in Stockholm only a few hours ago.
4. Missed the office, critical meetings, an exam, and a full day of work.
5. Had to arrange another train ticket to my final destination, which cost 1805 SEK.
7. Will return home at 23:35 instead of 7:00 a.m.
8. Traveling for 41 hours or more.

So, I suffered greatly as a result of Indigo's delay, and we are demanding full compensation, including the payment of my train tickets from Stockholm. 

P.S. Stockholm Arlanda (GPS 59.334591 North, 18.063240 East) as a final destination is not an selectable option above
