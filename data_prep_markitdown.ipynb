      "On 22 Jan, 2023 we had a flight from Kolkata (CCU) to Stockholm (ARN) (PNR  JV418P), with connections in Mumbai (BOM) and Istanbul (IST). The flight from Mumbai to Istanbul was delayed 8 hours. It was supposed to leave around 06:55 a.m., however it left at 14:30 on 23 Jan, 2023. This delay cost me numerous damages, including financial, academic, and work-related, which are described below.\n",
